## Problems with current ticketing systems :
1. Some people like to keep their tickets as collectibles, paper tickets can easily get damaged and hence can’t be kept for long. 
2. Online tickets are not worth keeping in the phone’s image gallery.
3.  Online ticketing solutions are prone to black marketing, bots can buy tickets in huge amounts and sell those at much higher prices later. 
4. Fake tickets scams are also pretty common.
5. In big events, celebrities might want to reward people who attended those events but would have to rely on third party sites to provide them this information.

## Why NFT tickets?
NFT based tickets have many advantages over traditional tickets. 
1. Firstly, the problem of black marketing can be tackled in many ways. NFT tickets can be programmed to be non-transferrable after the first transfer (owner to ticket holder). 
2. NFT tickets also prevent fake ticket frauds because they are on chains. 
3. NFT tickets exist on chains and can be viewed by everyone. 
4. They act as great collectibles for big events and event organisers can easily reward people holding these NFTs at any point of time in the future.
